How the Simulation Works

For each order, PLC executes:

Receive order from DES queue

Check inventory

Picking arm: part bin → staging

Kitting arm: staging → kitting tray

Mounting arm: tray → mounting area + mount operation

Soldering arm: solder operation

Output handling

Reset components

Mark order complete + track cycle time

The simulation tracks:

queued orders

WIP

completed orders

cycle times

per-arm utilization

per-arm failures

Tech Stack

Python 3.x

SimPy

PyQt5

NumPy

Matplotlib

PyOpenGL

Installation
pip install simpy pyqt5 numpy matplotlib pyopengl pyopengl-accelerate

Run
Main application (simulation + SCADA launcher)
python main.py


From the main window you can:

Start Simulation

Open SCADA Dashboard

Stop Simulation

Open 3D Visualization

Auto-launch 3D viewer after simulation completes

3D replay viewer directly
python visual.py


Then load a .jsonl log file.

Generated Output Files

When simulation runs/completes, files are created like:

kitting_station_1_plc_events_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jsonl
(streamed event log, line-by-line JSON)

kitting_station_1_plc_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
(final exported report data)

kitting_station_1_plc_cycle_times_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
(cycle times table)

Event Logging Format (JSONL)

Each event includes:

sim_time

category (e.g., PLC, ARM, ORDER, INVENTORY, OUTPUT)

event_type

additional event-specific fields

This log is what powers the replay and KPI analytics in visual.py.

SCADA & Analytics
SCADA (main dashboard)

Shows:

queued orders / WIP / completed

current station state

average cycle time

per-arm state and utilization

inventory/output states

progress toward order target

3D analytics window

Includes:

replay timeline with play/pause/step/speed controls

camera controls and visibility toggles

event log viewer

charts:

cycle time distribution

throughput over time

failures over time

metrics tab with order/failure/utilization summaries

text report export

Known Limitations

Motion is abstracted in 2D (no full 3D kinematic chain yet)

No torque or collision envelope yet

OpenGL text rendering may depend on local GLUT availability

Uses random failures for stress behavior (stochastic testing)

Suggested Next Steps

Add FK/IK module per arm (joint-level model)

Add workspace reachability checks before movement

Add payload-aware torque and speed constraints

Add collision detection with fixtures and workpieces

Add safety zones and interlock logic to PLC layer

Extend from Station 1 to multi-station orchestration
